# MNOGLA rawMouseEvtListener

Purpose:

Provides callback functions (user class implements by overriding) to mouse events

Callback function names: "evtMouseRaw_xyz".

Note: An empty implemention in the header file {} shows that the user implementation does not need to call the overridden base class function.
The empty default implementation allows the user class to only override selected functions.
